The game is about a young hacker(12-13)
Story will be narrated VN style, no voice, and still images in the background, with the image changing
every 2-3 dialogue.
The story isn't central to the game, but I need it to support the rest of the game adequately.
The games Unique selling Point lies in the fact that it teached actual hacking, with only minimal gloss
on the technical details(so as to keep the game enjoyable), unlike any game I could find.
The story then calls for me to be able to adequately place interesting enough hacks along the way
(I am thinking of around 2-3 hours gameplay including everything-thinking reading.)

The main story idea which I had from the start was this:
The game would start with a school student council elections where in the protag's friend is
contesting. The school has set a site for campaigning where the contestants can promise stuff,
Protag's friends page isn't what he submitted. He talks to protag.(Maybe the school can't access the site anymore as well)
I can put in a couple of hack's here, the protag would revert the site to original. 

Continuing with student council elections, anonymous poster defames protag's friend on a 
social network, hack account.
Here I can show a couple of more hacks.

Game starts,
Protag thinking what to hack...
Bell rings, mom announces friend has come, friend comes in.
tell us about said website. 
Here two hacks happen in succession,
For the first, he thinks hes got it, submits, No. 
Not working, the dude has changed the password. 
Hack 2 to actually get in the website.
